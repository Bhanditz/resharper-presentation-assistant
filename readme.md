# Presentation Assistant for ReSharper

Presentation Assistant is an extension for ReSharper 9.0 that will display the keyboard shortcuts for the currently executing action. Useful for demos, but also handy for pair programming "how did you do that?" questions.

You can download the plugin via the Extension Manager (currently available as pre-release, so enable pre-release packages in ReSharper -> Options -> Extension Manager)
